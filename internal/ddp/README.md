# Distributed Display Protocol (DDP)

This package implements the DDP server for the WLED simulator based on the [DDP specification](http://www.3waylabs.com/ddp/).

## Overview

DDP was designed for sending real-time data to distributed lighting displays where synchronization may be important. It provides a more efficient alternative to DMX-over-Ethernet protocols like Art-Net and E1.31.

## Packet Format

All packets sent and received have a 10 or 14 byte header followed by optional data.

### Header Structure

```
byte  0:    flags: V V x T S R Q P 
            V V:    2-bits for protocol version number, this document specifies version 1 (01).
            x:      reserved
            T:      timecode field added to end of header
                    if T & P are set, Push at specified time
            S:      Storage.  If set, data comes from Storage, not data-field.
            R:      Reply flag, marks reply to Query packet.
                    always set when any packet is sent by a Display.
                    if Reply, Q flag is ignored.
            Q:      Query flag, requests len data from ID at offset (no data sent)
                    if clear, is a Write buffer packet
            P:      Push flag, for display synchronization, or marks last packet of Reply

byte  1:    x x x x n n n n
            x: reserved for future use (set to zero)
            nnnn: sequence number from 1-15, or zero if not used
              the sequence number should be incremented with each new packet sent.
              a sender can send duplicate packets with the same sequence number and DDP header for redundancy.
              a receiver can ignore duplicates received back-to-back.
              the sequence number is ignored if zero.

byte  2:    data type
            set to zero if not used or undefined, otherwise:
            bits: C R TTT SSS
             C is 0 for standard types or 1 for Customer defined
             R is reserved and should be 0.
             TTT is data type 
              000 = undefined
              001 = RGB
              010 = HSL
              011 = RGBW
              100 = grayscale
             SSS is size in bits per pixel element (like just R or G or B data)
              0=undefined, 1=1, 2=4, 3=8, 4=16, 5=24, 6=32

byte  3:    Source or Destination ID
            0 = reserved
            1 = default output device
            2=249 custom IDs, (possibly defined via JSON config)
            246 = JSON control (read/write)
            250 = JSON config  (read/write)
            251 = JSON status  (read only)
            254 = DMX transit
            255 = all devices

byte  4-7:  data offset in bytes
            32-bit number, MSB first

byte  8-9:  data length in bytes (size of data field when writing)
            16-bit number, MSB first
            for Queries, this specifies size of data to read, no data field follows header.

if T flag, header extended 4 bytes for timecode field (not counted in data length)
byte 10-13: timecode

byte 10 or 14: start of data
```

## Implementation Notes

The WLED simulator implements:
- Version 1 of the DDP protocol
- RGB and RGBW data types with 8 bits per element
- Default output device (ID=1) and broadcast (ID=255)
- Packet validation with verbose error logging
- **Windowed sequence rejection** matching real WLED v16: only rejects packets whose sequence falls within a window of 5 behind the last PUSH packet's sequence (not strict duplicate rejection)
- **PUSH-aware rendering** matching real WLED v16: non-PUSH packets buffer pixel data silently; rendering only triggers on PUSH packets, or if no PUSH has ever been seen

### Sequence Handling

DDP sequence numbers are 4-bit (1-15), with 0 meaning "not used". The simulator tracks the sequence of the last PUSH packet (`lastPushSeq`) and rejects late packets that fall within a window of 5 behind it:
- If `lastPushSeq > 5`: reject if `seq > (lastPushSeq - 5) && seq < lastPushSeq`
- If `lastPushSeq <= 5`: reject with wraparound: `seq > (10 + lastPushSeq) || seq < lastPushSeq`
- Sequence 0 and duplicate sequences are always accepted

### PUSH Flag Behavior

The PUSH flag (bit 0 of byte 0) controls when the display renders:
- Non-PUSH packets: pixel data is buffered but no render is triggered
- PUSH packets: trigger a render and update `lastPushSeq`
- If no PUSH has ever been received, every packet triggers a render (for compatibility with senders that don't use PUSH)
